# The loader's EOF marker is 4 consecutive 0xFF bytes on the wire.
# load_program.py only ever checked 4-byte-*aligned* words, but the
# hardware watches the raw byte stream regardless of alignment - so
# any run of >=4 0xFF bytes that straddles a word boundary slips
# through untouched and gets misread as an early end-of-transmission.
# This is very likely with image/video data (white pixels = 0xFF).
#
# Fix: scan the true byte stream and break every run of >=4 0xFF
# bytes by nudging every 4th one down to 0xFE (visually negligible
# for a pixel value, same trick the old code intended but applied
# at the wrong granularity).
